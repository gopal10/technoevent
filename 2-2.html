<h3><b>Water Rocket:</b></h3>
<p>

    <b>Description:</b><br>
Have you ever dreamt of flying your own fuel powered rocket which is simple, safe and exciting? Then we bring you the ideal platform for showcasing your understanding of 'ΔP' and fluid dynamics with ‘THRUST’ A rocket to shoot up into the sky to grab exciting cash prize in store'. Thrust tests the participant's creativity in applying the effects of drag force on a dynamic domain and come up with clean, safe and novel design of rockets powered by simple fuels such as water (H2O). Balance between speed and control is just what is desired to design the Neolithic multi- stage propulsion

    Rules:
1. A team may consist of a maximum of 3 member 
2. Cross college teams are also allowed. 
3. The rocket must be built completely from scratch and not using model rocketry par 
4. The pressure vessel must be made from commercially available nonmetallic soda bottles (PET bottles). Fins if required are to be Constructed from lightweight non-metallic materials 
5. The rocket must use tap water as its primary reaction mass. 6. Thrust must come from expelling reaction mass/water, not from air discharge. 
6. Participants will be provided with tap water. 
7. The angle at which the rocket is to be launched can be decided by the participant. 
8. The rocket must use compressed air as its energy source. A normal bicycle pump as well as a foot pump will be provided to compress the air.
9. All parts of the rockets should be properly attached to the main body. If any part (fins etc.) breaks away during flight, it will compromise the Safety of the spectators: Therefore, such water rockets may be disqualified from further participation at the discretion of the organizers. 
10. Each team is strongly advised to bring two rockets of the same design (the second acting as a backup) in case of any damage. 
11. The organizers will not be responsible for damage suffered by rockets during the competition. Extra time shall not be given for remaking of damaged rockets.
